# Raccoon Simulator
Ah, the humble Raccoon. Otherwise known as "Nature's forbidden cat". Ever since you were a child, you've only ever had brief glimpses of them, which was never enough to sate your longing to domesticate wild, and possibly rabid, animals. But, now is your chance. With **Raccoon Simulator**, you can finally adopt one as a pet, without fear of rabies, exotic pet laws, or the "wild animal" smell. Name it, take care of it, and even put tiny pants on it- it's your raccoon.

Please note that this project is a **work in progress**.  

## About
**Raccoon Simulator** is a pet simulation game in which you can adopt, feed, care, and play with a virtual Raccoon. Choose from 3 raccoon presets, each with different in-game strengths and weaknesses. Earn money and spend it at the store on new items to use on your pet. When you're done, save the game and come back to it later.

**Raccoon Simulator** is programmed in C++ and entirely text-based with no GUI. I know, I know... 

## Current Features <sup>(accurate as of October 10th, 2019)</sup>
- Adopt a raccoon: choose from 3 presets with different traits, and give it a name. If you can't think of one, I suggest `Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya de la Rosa Ram√≠rez`, because it allows spaces and you're *really* getting your money's worth that way.
- Functioning inventory system that keeps track of all your items, separated by categories. <sup>(Although sometimes it shows the wrong category, but i'm working on that)</sup>
- Aging system with random stat decay that occurs overnight when the user selects it from the menu.
- Death! Remember to take care of your raccoon, or it'll die. Also, the game makes fun of you if this happens because the programmer's a jerk.
- Autosave when you create a new game, but you can save at any time by selecting it from the menu. <sup>Just be aware that inventory doesn't save yet.</sup> 

## Future Features
Definitely Happening:
- When the game is saved, also save the user's inventory
- Make the raccoon presets actually matter in-game through different reactions to items
- Anything in the code that says `//TODO:` or `//FIXME:`
- "Stinky" and "Hyper" buffs that happen to the raccoon. Stinky comes from choosing the Garbage Can option in play, and Hyper comes from choosing the Coffee option in Food. Causes random events telling you how smelly and/or annoying your raccoon currently is.

 Possibly Happening:
- Make the raccoon presets actually matter in-game through different reactions to items. Other option: Just remove them entirely.
- A GUI so things aren't so boring.
